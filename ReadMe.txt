Hi Travis! thank you for all the help :) 
Here are the instructions:
Goal: You're the imposter and you're trying to kill all the crewmates 
1. you can move up, left, and right using W, A, and D respectively
2. try to avoid getting hit by the GREY astrobuttons and the CYAN crewmates otherwise your sus meter will go up
3. if you get hit by the astrobutton 3 times, everything will slow down 
4. if you get hit by the astrobutton 6 times, you'll be voted off by the crewmates and lose :(
5. in order to kill the crewmates you have to shoot them
6. the mini GOLD blocks activate your gun!
7. you can use the 'B' button to shoot bullets at the astrobuttons or the crewmates, but once you hit something, your gun is deactivated
8. if you kill all 4 crewmates, you win!
9. click the 'select' button to start the game
10. once the game starts you can click the 'select' button to pause
